# ‚ú® Prompt Engineering with LLMs

This repository provides an overview of **Prompt Engineering**‚Äîthe art of crafting effective instructions to guide **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like GPT, LLaMA, Falcon, and more.

Prompt Engineering allows you to get powerful results without retraining the model. With well-structured prompts, you can unlock better performance for tasks like:

- üí¨ Question answering  
- üìÑ Summarization  
- üß† Logical reasoning  
- üõ† Code generation  
- üé® Creative writing

## üß† What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt Engineering** is the process of designing inputs (prompts) that guide LLMs to produce more accurate, relevant, and useful outputs.

Instead of changing the model, we change how we communicate with it.

Effective prompts can:
- Improve **accuracy and coherence**
- Reduce **hallucinations**
- Increase **controllability**
- Enable use across many tasks without fine-tuning

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- **Be specific**: Vague prompts lead to vague answers. Always clarify your goal.
- **Use examples**: Few-shot examples help models understand patterns and context.
- **Guide reasoning**: Use phrases like *‚Äúlet‚Äôs think step by step‚Äù* to encourage logic.
- **Test variations**: Small wording changes can yield very different results.
- **Limit instructions**: Too many instructions at once may confuse the model.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- Using ambiguous or overly broad prompts
- Asking multiple questions in a single prompt without clear separation
- Expecting high performance on specialized domains without proper context
- Ignoring token limits (especially with long few-shot examples)
