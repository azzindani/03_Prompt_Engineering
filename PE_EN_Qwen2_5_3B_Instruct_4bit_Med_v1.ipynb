            "**5. **Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD):** Diabetes increases the risk of developing PAD, a condition where the blood vessels in the legs and arms become narrowed or blocked, leading to pain and reduced blood flow.\n",
            "\n",
            "**6. **Gastroparesis (Delayed Stomach Emptying):** Diabetes can cause the stomach to empty its contents too slowly, leading to gastroparesis. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n",
            "\n",
            "**7. **Skin Conditions:** Diabetes can increase the risk of skin infections, such as fungal infections, and can also lead to skin conditions like diabetic dermopathy and diabetic foot ulcers.\n",

            "2. **Sulfonylureas:**\n",
            "   - **Mechanism of Action:** Sulfonylureas stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin. They work by binding to and activating sulfonylurea receptors on the pancreatic beta cells, which then release more insulin into the bloodstream.\n",
            "   - **Mechanism of Action:** Examples include glyburide (DiaBeta, Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol, Glucobay), and tolbutamide (Tolinase). These drugs work by increasing insulin secretion from the pancreas.\n",
