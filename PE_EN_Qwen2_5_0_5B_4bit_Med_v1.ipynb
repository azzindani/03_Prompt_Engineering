The symptoms of Type 2 diabetes can include fatigue, weight loss, increased thirst and urination, increased appetite, and blurred vision. The diagnostic markers for Type 2 diabetes include blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI). The treatments for Type 2 diabetes include lifestyle changes, medication, and insulin therapy. Early signs of Type 2 diabetes include increased thirst and urination, fatigue, weight loss, and increased appetite. The progression of Type 2 diabetes can lead to complications such as kidney failure, blindness, and amputation. Advanced stages of Type 2 diabetes include ketoacidosis, which is a condition where the body's insulin levels are too low, leading to a buildup of ketones in the blood. Early signs of ketoacidosis include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and confusion. The progression of ketoacidosis can lead to complications such as seizures, coma, and death.
